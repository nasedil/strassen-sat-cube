# strassen-sat-cube

This program in written as an attempt to find a Strassen-like algorithm for cube multiplication operation. The operation is a generalization of matrix multiplication, it procuduces 3-dimensional n by n by n array from three 3-dimensional n by n by n arrays.

The puzzle of finding such algorithm could be formulated differently, this is just one of ways.  The python scripts here create SAT-solver input files which may be passed to SAT solvers.

The program was written as a part of master thesis in informatics in 2013-2015 by Eugene Petkevich (Yevgheni Petkevich) in University of Bergen. Hopefully updates will follow here.
